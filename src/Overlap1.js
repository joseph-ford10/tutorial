        The Jefferson system allows us to transcribe when two (or more) people
        are speaking at the same time. When transcribing overlaps, we wrap the
        overlapping talk in square brackets. Here are some examples
      </p>
      <div className="examples">[oh no!] [that's great] [I see]</div>
      <p>
        The example below is supposed to be an overlap. However, it's missing
        the square brackets. Add them and press "Submit".
      </p>
    </main>

export default Overlap1
